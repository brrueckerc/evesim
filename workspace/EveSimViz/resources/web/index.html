<h1>Welcome to EvESimulator</h1>
As EvESim is a simulation framework running on digital ecosystem platforms, the
term simulation is often used interchangeably with emulation or even testing framework.<br>
<br>
With the planned migration of the already service oriented implementation
of EvESim to the currently developed OPAALS P2P system, EvESim will be one of the first running applications on top of this OPAALS infrastructure as well as on the Apache Tomcat based Soapod.<br>
<br>
Besides from that, the EvESimulator constitutes a collaborative platform for interdisciplinary research acting as a framework for understanding, visualising and presenting the social network concepts to contributors.
